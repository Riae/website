# 🎨 Personal Portfolio

![example](https://github.com/aymenae/website/blob/main/assets/screenshot.png)

A simple site to showcase the stuff I've made over the years. Check it out at [aymen.nl](https://aymen.nl/).

I've rewritten my old portfolio with lots of jazzy stuff using Lanyard, Catpuccin, SvelteKit & SCSS.
